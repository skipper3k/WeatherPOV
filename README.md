## Showcase weather app

In this Android Exercise you will create a working application that shows weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (http://openweathermap.org/api). The user can add multiple cities and check the weather in those cities. If possible, use the default Android components (this mainly concerns the widgets, donâ€™t use libraries just because they exist, you must have a solid reason to use each and every library).
